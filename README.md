# Skoltech Attitude Control
 Skoltech Attitude Control Project

the code in this repository is demonstrated by the following examples:

1. fullyMagnteicControlExample.m

A satellite in the circular orbit is magnetically controlled to keep its orbital orientation, attitude determination is performed by magnetometer-based Extended Kalman filter

the code is based on the paper D.S. Ivanov, M.Yu. Ovchinnikov et al.

Advanced numerical study of the three-axis magnetic attitude control and determination with uncertainties (Acta Astronautica
Volume 132, March 2017, Pages 103-110)

2. bDotExample.m

A satellite in the circular orbit that uses magnetorquers to damp its initial rotation
